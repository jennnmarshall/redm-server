# Jakes Edit Controls:
THE NPC THAT DRIVES THE TRAIN HAS TO STAY THERE DO NOT THROW HIM OUT.
These are the commands I added to control the train
/fullspeed
/halfspeed
/slowspeed
/stoptrain
/reverse
I do not know how the rest of this code works all i did was add commands so i will not be supporting this sorry.
